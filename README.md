## Demo
Check out our live demo: [Resume Generator App](https://job-app-ai.onrender.com/)

## Brief Description
We have developed an app that takes in two PDFs: one containing a user's information, such as their resume details, and another PDF of a job posting. Typically, resumes can be unnecessarily long or not targeted enough for specific job applications. Our app addresses this by analyzing both documents and generating a concise, job-specific resume based on the user’s details and the job posting. Initially, we had multiple ideas, such as automating the job application process based on the resume, but we ultimately decided to focus on resume generation and enhancing user-job matching.

In addition to the resume-building feature, we also implemented a mock interview simulation where two AI agents interact. This gives users insight into how they might be interviewed based on their resume and the job they're applying for.

## Challenges
One of the primary challenges we faced was generating a properly formatted PDF download button. Although we managed to generate the resume, formatting the PDF in a way that was readable and professional proved difficult. After multiple iterations, we successfully got the resume into an appropriate format.

The second challenge was with the mock interview feature. Initially, the questions posed by the interviewer AI were inaccurate or unrelated to the resume, despite the interviewee AI responding correctly. It took a while to pinpoint the issue, but we eventually fixed it, ensuring that both agents were in sync and the interview was relevant to the job and resume.

## Future Goals and Additions
We plan to continue working on this project and add new features. One potential enhancement is the ability to recommend jobs based on a user’s resume. Another goal is to automate the job application process fully and incorporate a feature that reviews the resume, providing it with a score and detailed feedback for improvements. Additionally, I aim to output resumes in specific formats, like the "Jake’s" resume template, which many recruiters prefer.
